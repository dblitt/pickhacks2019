LBM             = 0.407(weight) + 0.267(height) - 19.2 (male)
LBM             = 0.252(weight) + 0.473(height) - 48.3 (female)
water intake    = weight/2 = oz per day
weight lifted   
num of problems(cramps/fatigue)
protein intake  = 1.1~1.8 * weight


Suggestions (intake ave of LBM, ave weight lifted, ave protien intake, new LBM, water intake, weights lifted, protein intake, ex.Problems):
    compare aveLBM to newLBM:
        + => Good job
        - => check ave weight_lifted, protein, water, weight, etc. VS new weight_lifted, protein_intake, etc.
        Problems > 0: check anyway
        
WarnBefore (water intake,protein intake)
    if new intakes > 2*ave => slow down warning
    elif new intakes < ave/2 => intake more warning
